# Python & Backend Engineering Foundations

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language widely adopted in software engineering, automation, data processing, artificial intelligence, and backend system development.

Beyond its simplicity, Python enables the construction of scalable, maintainable, and well-architected systems — qualities essential for long-term software sustainability.

This repository documents a structured progression through Python fundamentals and backend development concepts, with a focus on strengthening engineering foundations, architectural thinking, and disciplined technical growth.
